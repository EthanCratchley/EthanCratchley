# Hey, I'm Ethan!

I'm currently studying Business Administration at the Beedie School of Business at Simon Fraser University. I plan to enroll in a Business Administration and Computer Science Joint Major program.

This fall, I will be taking Discrete Math, Managerial Economics, Financial Accounting, and Introduction to Computer Science.

This year, I will be conducting equity research on various financial instruments for the SFU Investing Club, where we will also compete in stock pitch competitions, investing challenges, and case studies.

I love to continuously challenge myself and learn.

In my spare time I am studying artificial intelligence and working to improve my technical capabilities as I prepare for my next project

To stay active, I play soccer recreationally and also run, bike, and lift in preparation for my next event. I am also working on improving my tennis and golf game.

In the future I plan to build SaaS products for businesses and people.
