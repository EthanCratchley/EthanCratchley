# Hey, I'm Ethan!

I'm currently studying Business Administration at the Beedie School of Business at Simon Fraser University. I plan to enroll in a Business Administration and Computer Science Joint Major program.

This summer I will be working on the Operations team at Wilson M. Beck Insurance.

I am currently studying algorithm optimization and improving my technical capabilities. As well as doing research on various financial instruments.

I love to continuously challenge myself and learn.

In the future I plan to build SAAS products for businesses and people.
